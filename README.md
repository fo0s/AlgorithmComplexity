# Algorithm Complexity

> In computer science, the time complexity is the computational complexity that describes the amount
> of time it takes to run an algorithm. Time complexity is commonly estimated by counting the number of
> elementary operations performed by the algorithm, supposing that each elementary operation takes a fixed
> amount of time to perform. Thus, the amount of time taken and the number of elementary operations
> performed by the algorithm are taken to differ by at most a constant factor.

### Ruby Timer

A simple timer class made to time the amount of time it takes for a block of code 
to be completed.
